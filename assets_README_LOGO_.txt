Place your final logo (SVG or raster) into the assets/ folder with one of these filenames:
- assets/logo.svg  (preferred, vector)
- OR assets/logo.png (raster). 

Then export the PNGs into assets/ using the commands in README.md (logo-512.png, logo-192.png, logo-180.png, logo-128.png, logo-64.png, logo-32.png, favicon.ico).
